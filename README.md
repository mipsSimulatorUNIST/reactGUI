# MIPS GUI

This GUI is a step-by-step visualization to help you understand the principles of the MIPS simulator.

It was conducted in conjunction with the [MIPS Simulator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mips-simulator-js) project, which is an open-source project.

### Getting Started

The completed GUI can be found at this [link](https://mipssimulatorunist.github.io/reactGUI/).

## Introduction

This GUI was developed as REACT and is implemented for `Assembler` and `Simulator`, which are the main functions of MIPS simulator.

The first tab implements the [Assembler](#Assembler) function of converting assembly files into binary files, and the second tab implements the [Simulator](#Simulator) that shows how the register data stack changes for each cycle.

## Usage

### Assembler

> The assembler is divided into `assembly panel` and `binary panel` to show how the assembly language is translated into binary.

1. Step-by-step translation

2. Specific command selection

### Simulator

> The simulator shows the commands currently running and displays changes in registers, data, and stacks when you run them.
